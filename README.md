# Trivia JavaScript
by Remy van der Wereld

## Process

I chose to refactor the code instead of testing the application. As a software developer I want to understand the code before doing anything with it. There was no time to implement tests within two hours.

## Findings

- There is a very small risk that the questions will run out before a winner is known.
- Because the winner is determined by probability, the first player has a much higher chance of winning the game. This can be solved by rolling the dice to see who goes first.
